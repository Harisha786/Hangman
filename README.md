# ðŸ”¤ Hangman Game (Flask Web App)

This is a fun, browser-based **Hangman Game** built with **Python Flask** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend. Guess letters to reveal a hidden word before you run out of tries!

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- A random word is selected when the game starts.
- You guess letters by clicking buttons.
- If the letter is correct, it appears in the word.
- If the letter is wrong, you lose a try.
- Win by guessing the full word before all tries run out.
